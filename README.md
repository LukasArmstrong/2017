## Project for code louisville
##### To  open: 
   - Click on the one of the HTML files. Perferably index.html
   
##### Known Issues:
   - Clcik function in *modal.js* is pulling by id and inturn pulling the title of the first image. Not the title of the current image.
   - **Planned way of fixing:** using JQuery to make when clicked on one of the elements, uses a *this* and not am *id*

##### Suggestions for improvement:
    
    1. Hover for link
    2. add active so users know where they are in the site.
    3. work on CSS for the modals
    4. add a shopping feature.
